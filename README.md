# Traffic-Video-Analytics-using-YOLOv7-in-Computer-Vision
C-DAC Patna PG-DAI Batch 15 March 2023 Capstone Project
#### Traffic video analytics is an important technology for managing traffic flow and improving road safety. One of the key challenges in traffic video analytics is the accurate classification of vehicles and detection of pedestrians from video footage in real-time. In recent years, deep learning-based approaches have shown great promise in addressing this problem. One such approach is the YOLOv7 algorithm, which is a state-of-the-art object detection algorithm that uses a single neural network to perform both object detection and classification. In this project, we present a study on YOLOv7 for realtime vehicle classification and pedestrian detection from traffic video footage. We first describe the YOLOv7 algorithm in detail and discuss its strengths and limitations. We then present our methodology for applying YOLOv7 to the task of vehicle classification and pedestrian detection. We evaluate the performance of our approach on a custom dataset of traffic video footage and compare it with other state-ofthe-art object detection algorithms. Our results show that YOLOv7 is a highly accurate and efficient algorithm for real-time vehicle classification and pedestrian detection, with superior performance compared to other algorithms.
